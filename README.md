# React Tic-Tac-Toe

## Introduction
This my attempt at creating a React web application based around the [React Tic-Tac-Toe Tutorial](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

## To Implement:
- [ ] For the current move, only show "You are at move #..." instead of a button
- [x] Rewrite `Board` to use two loops to make the squares instead of harcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
